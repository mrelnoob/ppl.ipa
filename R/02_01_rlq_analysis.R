##### 1. RLQ analysis #####
# ----------------------- #
# *----------------------------------------------------* #####
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
##### * 1.1. Preliminary two-tables analyses -----------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

## A preliminary step of RLQ analysis is to perform the separate analyses of each table. Because of the two
# tables associated with the two margins of the L table (L = link; the site x species table), the L table has
# to be symmetric and should thus be transformed using a Correspondence Analysis.



##### ** 1.1.1. L table ordination (Correspondence Analysis) ----
# _______________________________________________________________

## The site x species table (L table) can be viewed as a contingency table. As such, correlations between rows
# and columns can be computed as a Chi2 statistic. E.g.:
#   test1 <- chisq.test(wdata)
#   test1$statistic # XÂ² = 13019.06!
# The CoA decompose this link across several axes:
otable.l_coa <- ade4::dudi.coa(df = wdata, scannf = FALSE, nf = 2) # 'otable' is for "ordination table", 'l'
# is for the L table, and 'coa' is for Correspondence Analysis! The same logic will be followed in the next
# sections.
# sum(otable.l_coa$eig)*sum(wdata) # Yields the same value!
ade4::scatter(x = otable.l_coa, poseig = "bottomright")
ade4::sco.distri(score = otable.l_coa$l1[,1], df = wdata, labels = colnames(wdata)) # To get the conditional
# variances of the columns (species) on the first axis (i.e. something like the variances of the species
# abundances in the sites represented by this axis in which they occur).
## For some reason, there consistently is an overlap between "Falco subbuteo" and "Cuculus canorus". A possible
# reason could be that they are double-ones (they co-occur in the same single site). Moreover, some species
# seem to have quite variable abundances among sites, especially the "aerial" species (e.g. Apus apus).
ade4::sco.distri(otable.l_coa$c1[,1], df = data.frame(t(wdata)), labels = rownames(wdata)) # To get the
# conditional variances of the rows (sites) on the first axis (i.e. something like the variances, on this
# axis, of the species of this site).
## On the 1st axis, IPA074 seem to have an oddly large variance of species abundances, but that seems normal
# as it is solely drawn by the high abundances of some "aerial" species.
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
ade4::sco.label(otable.l_coa$co[, 1], lab = colnames(wdata), reverse = TRUE,
          boxes = FALSE, horizontal = FALSE, lim = c(-2.5, 2.5), pos.lab = 0.3)
ade4::sco.label(otable.l_coa$l1[, 1], horizontal = FALSE, lim = c(-2.5, 2.5),
          boxes = FALSE)
ade4::s.value(xy, otable.l_coa$l1[, 1], addaxes = FALSE, include.origin = FALSE)
ade4::s.value(xy, otable.l_coa$l1[, 2], addaxes = FALSE, include.origin = FALSE) # Ordinations suggest
# the existence of a rather clear spatial structure.

##### ** 1.1.2. R table ordination (Principal Component Analysis) ----
# ____________________________________________________________________

# As the site x environment (R table) contains both quantitative and (one) qualitative variables , we should
# theoretically ordinate it using an Hill and Smith's Analysis. Furthermore, to enable the coupling of this
# table with the species table, we also have to weigh lines using the line weight from the CoA.
# Unfortunately, the Hill & Smith's Analysis precludes the inclusion of ordered factors and the alternative,
# a "mixed analysis", does not allow row weightings.
# Consequently, I should either drop my ordered factor or convert it into a numeric variable and then run
# a Principle Component Analysis (PCA). I chose the latter solution (I could also have changed the factor
# into an unordered one but I deemed preferable to keep the ordered nature of its levels despite having to
# assume an imprecise difference of 1-unit between them - i.e. the conversion below assumes that the
# difference between A and B and C and D levels is always equal to 1, which is likely not exactly true):
wmetrics %>% dplyr::mutate(plant_evenness = dplyr::case_when(
  evenness_class == "D" ~ 0,
  evenness_class == "C" ~ 1,
  evenness_class == "B" ~ 2,
  evenness_class == "A" ~ 3)) %>%
  dplyr::rename(plant_richness = species_richness) %>%
  dplyr::relocate(plant_evenness, .after = plant_richness) %>%
  dplyr::select(-evenness_class) -> wmetrics

otable.r_pca <- ade4::dudi.pca(df = wmetrics, row.w = otable.l_coa$lw, # Row weights.
                             scannf = FALSE, nf = 2)
ade4::scatter(x = otable.r_pca)
summary(otable.r_pca) # Indicates that the first 2 axes account for ~30% and ~21% of the total inertia.
otable.r_pca$c1 %>% dplyr::arrange(desc(CS2)) # To get the variable loadings on the axes (on descending order
# according to the second axis 'CS2' values).
# --> The first PC seems to represent a kind of building density gradient, as it opposes building metrics and
#     landcover metrics (or 'bgaps', i.e. the proportion of gaps between buildings) and, to a some extent, the
#     connectivity variables (although their loadings/scores are not that high on this axis), suggesting that
#     connectivity is generally higher in scarcely built sites.
# --> The second PC seems to represent a urban park/industrial area to residential housing gradient, as it
#     opposes sites with few large and well spaced buildings with a large amount of quite highly connected
#     forest patches, against sites characterised by many small buildings (e.g. houses), higher shrub habitat
#     proportions and connectivity, higher woody plant diversity (e.g. ornamentals), and quite high
#     grassland connectivity.
ade4::inertia.dudi(x = otable.r_pca, row.inertia = TRUE, col.inertia = TRUE) # To get the contributions
# of rows and columns in the ordination.
## Some sites seem quite (overly?) influential: e.g. IPA056 and IPA071. Otherwise, we could say that the
# first 2 axes adequately describe a large portion of the urban gradient.
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
ade4::s.value(xy, otable.r_pca$l1[, 1], addaxes = FALSE, include.origin = FALSE)
ade4::s.value(xy, otable.r_pca$l1[, 2], addaxes = FALSE, include.origin = FALSE) # Ordinations once again
# show some spatial patterns confirming our interpretation. The spatial arrangement of the 2nd axis values
# furthermore emphasises the fact that urban gradients go beyond simple centre-periphery or dense-not dense
# gradients.

##### ** 1.1.3. Q table ordination (Hill & Smith's Analysis) ----
# _______________________________________________________________

# As the species x traits (Q table) contains both quantitative and (one) qualitative variables , we should
# ordinate it using an Hill and Smith's Analysis. Furthermore, to enable the coupling of this table with
# the species table, we also have to weigh lines using the column weight from the CoA.
otable.q_hsa <- ade4::dudi.hillsmith(df = wtraits, row.w = otable.l_coa$cw,
                                     scannf = FALSE, nf = 2)
ade4::scatter(x = otable.q_hsa)
summary(otable.q_hsa) # Indicates that the first 2 axes account for ~31% and ~18% of the projected inertia.
otable.q_hsa$c1 %>% dplyr::arrange(desc(CS1)) # Or CS2.
# --> The first axis seems is rather hard to interpret as it opposes birds with many different attributes,
#     but it seems partly linked to the reproductive and foraging strategies with, on one side, small "quick
#     POLS" birds that forage and nest mainly in woody vegetation or on the ground and, on the other side,
#     big "slow POLS" birds that forage in the air or exclusively on the ground (e.g. swallows or pigeons).
# --> The second PC clearly opposes aerial birds (and their other traits) or some small forest passerines to
#     bigger birds such as corvids or pigeons.
dev.off()



##### ** 1.1.4. RL and QL tests (Co-Inertia Analysis) ----
# ________________________________________________________

## To investigate if the links between species and environment or between traits and distribution are
# strong and significant, we can run Co-Inertia Analyses (COIA).
otable.rl_coia <- ade4::coinertia(dudiX = otable.l_coa, dudiY = otable.r_pca, scannf = FALSE, nf = 2)
otable.l_coa2 <- ade4::dudi.coa(df = t(wdata), scannf = FALSE, nf = 2) # Same CoA but with a transposed matrix.
otable.ql_coia <- ade4::coinertia(dudiX = otable.l_coa2, dudiY = otable.q_hsa, scannf = FALSE, nf = 2)

test1 <- ade4::randtest.coinertia(otable.rl_coia, fixed = 1)
